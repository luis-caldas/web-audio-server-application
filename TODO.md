#### #TODO

 - [ ] Set fixed port for api and check for api connection on startup

 - [ ] More strict checks (such as when android user pauses through notification) for play pause icon

 - [ ] Custom context menu for right click with the option to download

 - [ ] Check api connection and raise errors

 - [ ] Better icons for shuffle and repeat

 - [ ] Fix popstate and history to match the one of the browsing, so the forward arrow may work as well.
 - [ ] Block return arrow when on root directory, and allow normal browser return
